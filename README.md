# TensorFlow Data and Deployment Specialization

Welcome to my TensorFlow Data and Deployment Specialization Journey Repository! ðŸš€

## About

This repository documents my learning path and projects as I work towards completing the TensorFlow: Data and Deployment Specialization. 
I am currently enrolled in the 4 course series offered by Deeplearning.ai on Coursera. 
Join me in understanding how to train and run machine learning models in browsers and in mobile applications, learn how to leverage built-in datasets with just a few lines of code, learn about data pipelines with TensorFlow data services, use APIs to control data splitting, process all types of unstructured data, and retrain deployed models with user data while maintaining data privacy. My new knowledge will be applied in various deployment scenarios and as I get introduced to TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow, Hub, TensorBoard, and more. 


## Directory Structure

- `01_Browser_based_TF_JS`: Train and run machine learning models in any browser using TensorFlow.js.
- `02_Device_based_TF_lite`: Learn how to run machine learning models in mobile applications, execute models on both Android and iOS platforms, and explore how to deploy on embedded systems using TensorFlow on Raspberry Pi and microcontrollers.
- `03_Data_pipelines`: Perform streamlined ETL tasks using TensorFlow Data Services, use TensorFlow Hub and TensorFlow Data Services APIs, and optimize data pipelines.
- `04_Advanced_deployment`: Introduction to TensorFlow Serving and TensorBoard.

Feel free to explore the directories and projects to follow along with my learning journey.
